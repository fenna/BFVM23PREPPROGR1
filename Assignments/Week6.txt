Take your DNA reverse complement script and introduce exception handling were appropriate. 

At least use it for the following:

    Catch an exception upon a KeyError in the complement function
    Catch an exception upon a FileNotFoundError in upon opening the file
    Create a custum exception class and call it NotDnaBaseError. 
        Put it in a module custom_error.py together with a function "validate" that validates the data. 
        Make use of this custom exception class.
