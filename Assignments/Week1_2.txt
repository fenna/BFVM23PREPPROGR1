Q1
Write a program that will ask an user to type a number above 0
Print if the number is odd or even. 


Q2
Write a program that prints all numbers that are greater than 5 from a list with numbers
Take for example this list: [1, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8, 9, 0]

Extra1:
Instead of printing, add the numbers to a new list and print this list in the end

Extra2:
Ask an user to type a number and use that instead of the 5


Q3
Write a program that will ask the user to type a string.
Determine if the string is a palindrome (string reads same backwards as forwards)


Q4
Write a program that create a new list from an existing one, only taking the first and last elements.

Note: this should work for any given list (length may vary)


Q5
Write a program that takes a list and returns the same list with all duplicates removed


Q6
Write a program that asks an user to type in a sentence and prints the words in reverse.
ie, hello my name is Ronald 
shoudl print: Ronald is name my hello

Tip. Look at the str method(split)


Q7
Write a program that will take a list with numbers and will count the number of duplicates (per duplicate). 
The duplicate should be stored in a dictionary together with the how many times it occurs in the list.


Q8
Write a program that will rempove empty tuples from a list with tuples.

list_with_tuples = [(), (), ("",), ("A", "B"), ("a", "b", "c"), ("d",), ()]
expected output = [("",), ("A", "B"), ("a", "b", "c"), ("d",)]


Q9
Write a program to replace the last element in a list with another list
Example_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]
Expected_output = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]


Q10
Write a program that will determine what the type is of each element in a list.
For each type a new list should be created and the item should be added to the correct list.

example_list = [1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, (5, 6), ['For', 'Geeks'], {"Python": "Awesome"}]


Q11
Write a program that will aks the name of a user and also the age.
Store this in a dictionary.


Q12
Write a program that will check if a given key already exists in dictionary, if it exist print the value otherwise add the new key and give it an empty string as value.

Given this dict:
d = {"Students": "start practicing ;-)"}

Asking the key: "students" will print: "start practicing ;-)"
asking anything else should results of what has been asked beeing added to the dict.

ie. asking: "Teacher", should result in the addition of this string to the dict with an empty string as value -> d = {"Students": "start practicing ;-)", "Teacher": ""}


Q13
Write a program that will loop over a dictionary and print each key and value.

Tip: look at the keys() and items() methods of dictionary
Extra: show the workings of your program using both mentioned methods above


Q14
Count how many dictionaries have succes as True.
example_dictionary = [{'id': 1, 'success': True, 'name': 'Lary'}, {'id': 2, 'success': False, 'name': 'Rabi'}, {'id': 3, 'success': True, 'name': 'Alex'}]
