    "# Week 01 Assignment genes expressed in the brain\n",
    "\n",
    "For the assignment of week 2 we will continue to work on the expression data from the human brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning outcomes:\n",
    "- know how to work with ordered data datatypes: list, tuple, set\n",
    "- can use list comprehensions \n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment for this week is again divided up in several steps (some of which are overlapping with the previous assignment). The general layout of what the program should do for this week is:\n",
    "- Read the data\n",
    "- Prepare the data\n",
    "- Process the data\n",
    "- report on results of the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "By now you will be familiar with the reading and preparing part of the data and we will add research questions for you to answer using Python and the new learning outcomes of this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "    **Note:** For this week you should not copy and paste your code for every step and add the appropriate code for the next step. Instead, you are going to write all code in just one code cell.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research question/outcome\n",
    "1. The number of probes is larger than the number of genes. This is because there is a redundancy in the number of probes per gene. Select per gene the probe that has the highest average expression across the samples.\n",
    "2. When comparing the \"lateral hypothalamic area, mammillary region\" and \"posterior hypothalamic area\" show what the unique probes per region are and also the probes that are shared between the two brain regions. The structure acronyms are '\"LHM\" and '\"PHA'\" and can be found in the `SampleAnnot.csv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some coding requirements for this assignment and you should make sure that you use following techniques:\n",
    " - use a dictionary structure to store the probes per gene\n",
    " - create and use a listcomprehension (where appropriate)\n",
    " - use the methods of the set datatype to get the difference and shared probe ids between the two brain regions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "- the number of probes per gene can be found when looking at the first and third column of the `Probes.csv` file. Make sure to skip the header\n",
    "- The file `SampleAnnot.csv` contains the samples in the same order as the samples in the `MicroarrayExpression.csv` file. The "
