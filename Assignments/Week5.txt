OO assignments

Q1
Design an student object based on the following properties and behaviour
-has a first name
-has a last name
-has an age
-has a class
-has a tutor

When a student is created the first and last name + class should be mandetory.
Implement the functionality that will enforce this.

Show that your code is working by instantiating 5 different student objects
and asking the first and last name + class of each student


Q2
Students should also be able to say their complete name.
Add a method say_name that will print the first and last name (use str.format())


Q3
add a method that will allow you to print a student object.
Whenever a student is printed te output should look like this (use str.format())

first name: students firstname
lastname: students lastname
class: students class

Tip, \n will print a newline


Q4
Add a method that will set the age of the student. The age should be checked, only add the age if it is above 16, print an message if it is not.
create two new students, one that is 18 and one that is 12. The age should not be given when creating the object, you have to call this method explicitly.


Q5
Add a class variable that will hold the name of every created student
Add a class variable that can be used to keep track of how many students are created
When creating a student his/her first name should be added to this class variable and the count variable should grow by 1
Create 5 students and show after the last student has been created the content of this class variable and the count variable.


Q6
Now design a Master student, that will inherent from the student class.
Every master student should have a previous eduction variable that needs to be provided during creation of the object

Remember to also fullfill the requirements of the base (Student) class
