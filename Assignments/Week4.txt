Q1
Write a program that will read a fasta file. The name should be given on the commandline.
When reading the fasta file, save the header in a dictionary as the key together with the sequence as the value.
Before saving the header, remove the >  from the description

Use a very simple fasta file:
>1
AAAAAAA
>2
TTTTTTT
>3
CCCCCC
>4
GGGGGG

Check in the end if all sequences are saved
Expected output (remember your output may differ, order is not garanteed in a dict:

my_fasta_dict = {"1":"AAAAAAA", "2":"TTTTTTT", "3": "CCCCCC", "4":"GGGGGG"}

Write the reverse complement of each sequence together with the header to a new fasta file using the functions from your previous modules
