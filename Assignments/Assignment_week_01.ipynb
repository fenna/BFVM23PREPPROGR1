    "# Week 01 Assignment genes expressed in the brain\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the preparatory programming course! Here, you'll learn to develop software programs using the basics of Python. You'll explore Python's built-in functions to tackle assignments, giving you a solid grasp of how data manipulation works right from the ground up. Forget about fancy tools like pandas and numpy in this course â€“ we're sticking to the simple yet powerful features of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "By diving into these foundational Python concepts, you'll sharpen your skills for solving problems with logical thinking and turning those solutions into functional code. These skills are fundamental building blocks of programming, and you'll be mastering them in the coming 7 weeks. This first week we will look into reading and manipulating files. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this week you should be able to translate a simple datadriven question into a working Python program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning outcomes of this week are:\n",
    "- can use the Linux shell to navigate and do simple text processing\n",
    "- use the correct Python data types to store data\n",
    "- know how to use flow control\n",
    "- can read a text file into the Python environment\n",
    "- can use f-string formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course we will use data that was made available through the Allen Institute for Brain Science. For the assignment of week 1 we are going to have a look at microarray expression data taken from multiple locations (samples) in the brain of one individual. Please have a look at the experimental setup using the following link: [background reading](https://help.brain-map.org/download/attachments/2818165/WholeBrainMicroarray_WhitePaper.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1433804560874&api=v2)\n",

    "\n",
    "The end goal of this week is a program that will read a file containing measured expression values from probes capturing active genes in the human brain. From all active genes in the brain we would like to know:\n",
    "- which gene has the highest maximum expression over all samples measured\n",
    "- which gene has the highest average expression over all samples \n",
