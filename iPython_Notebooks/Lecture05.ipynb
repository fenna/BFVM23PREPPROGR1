We can recognize an object by the **dot** (**.**) notation that we have to use to get access to the functions and variables of an object. In object terminology a class function is called a method and a class variable is called an attribute.\n\nFor example, remember the string.upper() method? This is an example of calling the upper() method on the string object. We can see that we used the dot operator after the name of the object we want to use and that the method will work in the variables that are saved in the object (called the object state).\n\nIn general we can say that objects have a **state** (variables or **attributes** called in objects) and **behavior** (functions or **methods** calles in objects) that work on these variables).\n\nObjects are defined in so called **classes**. Which are the blueprint of the object to be created. Object can be called into live (object instantiation) by assigning this blueprint to a variable.\n\nThere are a few things that should be kept in mind when writing classes.\n \n- class names start with a capital letter and are camelcase\n- class definition start with the keyword class\n- After the class name there is a semicolon (:)\n\nLet's create a simple class definintion and call the object into life by assigning it to a variable.\n\n"

The combination of data and operations into a single package. If we just want to store data we could have used a list or a dictionary and if we would only like to perfom some action we could write a function, if on the other hand we would like to combine data and operations than we should think objects."

But what is that **self** argument doing in the `objectMethod` and again the **self** in the print statement when refering to the objectVariable (`self.objectVariable`)? \n\n**self** is a reference to the object created and is **always passed as the first argument of any object method** and this is how attributes of the object are kept local to that object. Instead of writing a function like: `def somefunction(): pass`, we now have to write the method like `def someObjectMethod(self)`. And when calling an attribute in the object we have to use self to acces it. This ensures that even when the method has finished (and all variables are removed by the garbage collector) the attribute still lives in on the object level and is accessible.\n\nThe strange thing is we do not need to pass self as an argument from outside the object. Look at the previous example and note that when the object is created we call the objectMethod using the dot notation and we did not pass self as the first argument. This is because the Python interpreter does this for you.\n\nThe same goes for calling a method from another method in the object, we have to use the self reference to point to the method, as is shown in the next example."
